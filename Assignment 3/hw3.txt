Q1.According to the patch file, 
-          if (ignore_mode == IGNORE_DEFAULT)
-            ignore_mode = IGNORE_DOT_AND_DOTDOT;
+          ignore_mode = IGNORE_DOT_AND_DOTDOT;

The patch deleted an if statement. Thus, "ls" now
has better performance since there's one less step.

Q2.According to the patch file,
Some other files such as the local.mk file and the
a-option.sh file have also been modified. Therefore,
we need to watch out for the modified parts in these
Two files as well. Also, we need to be careful when 
applying patch files because when changes have been 
made to the original file, patches can no longer be
applied to the file due to mis-match.

Q3.python randline.py /dev/null
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "randline.py", line 70, in <module>
    main()
  File "randline.py", line 64, in main
    sys.stdout.write(generator.chooseline())
  File "randline.py", line 34, in chooseline
    return random.choice(self.lines)
  File "/usr/lib64/python2.7/random.py", line 274, in choice
    return seq[int(self.random() * len(seq))]  
    # raises IndexError if seq is empty
IndexError: list index out of range

This problem occurs because seq is empty since the number of 
lines of an empty file is zero, which raises the IndexError 
list out of range.

Q4.python3 randline.py test2.txt 
  File "randline.py", line 65
    except IOError as (errno, strerror):
                      ^
SyntaxError: invalid syntax

Using python3, a SyntaxError occurs. This is due to the
fact that python3 merges IOError into OSError, so the
syntax should be changed accordingly in pyton3.
