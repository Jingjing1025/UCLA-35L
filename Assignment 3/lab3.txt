1. "wget ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/coreutils/coreutils-8.29.tar.xz"
I used this command to download the file, and then
"tar -xf coreutils-8.29.tar.xz"
to  extract the file

I then went into that directory, downloaded signature and keyring
"wget ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/coreutils/coreutils-8.29.tar.xz.sig"
"wget https://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/gnu-keyring.gpg"
and used the command: 
"gpg --verify --keyring ./gnu-keyring.gpg coreutils-8.29.tar.xz.sig"
to verify the signature and got:
gpg: Signature made Wed Dec 27 10:29:05 2017 PST using RSA key ID 306037D9
gpg: Good signature from "P?draig Brady <P@draigBrady.com>"
gpg:                 aka "P?draig Brady <pbrady@redhat.com>"
gpg:                 aka "P?draig Brady <pixelbeat@gnu.org>"
gpg: WARNING: This key is not certified with a trusted signature!
gpg:          There is no indication that the signature belongs to the owner.
Primary key fingerprint: 6C37 DC12 121A 5006 BC1D  B804 DF6F D971 3060 37D9
The problems suggest that we cannot ensure that the
signature belongs to the owner so the signature is not trusted.

2. I first used "ls" to check for the files in that directory
and then I used "less INSTALL" to look through
the instructions of how to install the application.

Based on the instructions, I used
"./configure --prefix=/u/ch/ugrad/jingjing/lab3" 
to configure the package for my system and change the install
location to /u/ch/ugrad/jingjing/lab3 by "prefix".

"make" 
to compile the package

"make install"
to install the programs and any data files and documentation.

3.I then went to the directory /u/ch/ugrad/jingjing/lab3
and created the command "la" using "emacs la"

#!/bin/sh
exec /u/ch/ugrad/jingjing/lab3/coreutils-8.29/src/ls -a "$@"

And I then typed "./la -A" with the results:
.    coreutils-8.29    	   gnu-keyring.gpg  lab3.txt~  share
..   coreutils-8.29.tar.xz la		    	        la~
bin  coreutils-8.29.tar.xz.sig				lab3.txt	 libexec

Here, the bug occurs since the dot files still appear 
when they are not supposed to becuase of "-A"

4.I first went to the directory
"cd /u/ch/ugrad/jingjing/lab3/coreutils-8.29/"
And then I created a patch_file and copied the patch into it
Then I used "patch -p1 < patch_file" to apply the patch
(NEWS file failed the patching, but the bugs could still be fixed)

5. I typed the command "make" to build the corrected file
The commands generated are as followed:
  CC       src/ls.o
  CCLD     src/dir
  CCLD     src/ls
  CCLD     src/vdir
  GEN      man/dir.1
  GEN      man/ls.1
  GEN      man/vdir.1
They are used for compilation, linking, and documentation purposes
The other cmmands are noe executed because there's nothing that 
needs to be done

6. I first tested the unmodified version of ls 
by changing the la command shell file

#!/bin/sh
exec /u/ch/ugrad/jingjing/lab3/bin/ls -a "$@"

And I then typed "./la -A" with the results:
.    coreutils-8.29        gnu-keyring.gpg  lab3.txt~  share
..   coreutils-8.29.tar.xz la                           la~
bin  coreutils-8.29.tar.xz.sig                          lab3.txt         libexec

There are still bugs because dot files still exist.

And then I tested the fixed version by changing the la file:

#!/bin/sh
exec /u/ch/ugrad/jingjing/lab3/coreutils-8.29/src/ls -a "$@"

And I then typed "./la -A" with the results:
bin          coreutils-8.29.tar.xz.sig  lab3.txt   libexec
coreutils-8.29		    gnu-keyring.gpg		  lab3.txt~  share
coreutils-8.29.tar.xz  la            la~

Since the dot files now disappear, the bugs are fixed.
