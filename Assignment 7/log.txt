For this lab, I first reset and flashed my BeagleBone for better performance.
I followed the instructions, and installed drivers.

I then reset my BeagleBone using a microSD card:
I downloaded the latest image of BBGW, udecompressed it, and then used the 
microSD adapter and the software Etcher to write the image to my SD card.
the file /boot/uEnv.txt has also been modified by deleting the "#" in front of
the line "cmdline=init=/opt/scripts/tools/eMMC/init-eMMC-flasher-v3.sh".
I then powered down my BeagleBone, and inserted my SD card into the BeagleBone.
Then, I waited for about 10 minutes for flashing to finish.
Lastly, I powered down the BeagleBone, removed the SD card, and re-powered it.

Next, I SSHed to BeagleBone using "sudo ssh root@192.168.7.2",
and used "sudo connmanctl" to connect my Beaglebone to wifi.
Connect to Wifi:
connmanctl> enable wifi
connmanctl> scan wifi
connmanctl> services
connmanctl> agent on
connmanctl> connect wifi_506583d4fc5e_544e434150413937414239_managed_psk
Passphrase? 3760ClassNet
connmanctl> quit

Then, I updated the database of apt-get:
"sudo apt-get update"
and installed xauth and xvfb for X11 forwarding support for future SSH 
connections to my BeagleBone using:
"sudo apt-get install xauth"
"sudo apt-get install xvfb"

I then installed XQuartz, made sure X11 was enabled on BeagleBone, and
installed Firefox.

Next, my partner and I worked together to log into each other's host.
First, I installed OpenSSH using the commands:
"sudo apt-get update"
"sudo apt-get install openssh-server"
"sudo apt-get install openssh-client"

I then set up the Server account by using the following commands
• sudo useradd -d /home/Nimkar -m nimkar
• sudo passwd nimkar

Then, I created a .ssh folder in nimkar's home directory, assigned him
the ownership, and changed the mode to 700.
• cd /home/Nimkar
• sudo mkdir .ssh
• sudo chown -R nimkar .ssh
• sudo chmod 700 .ssh

I then used "ifconfig", and found that my ip address was 10.97.85.72 
So he can log in using this ip address.    
• ps aux | grep ssh                           
root      1151  0.0  0.7   9224  3788 ?        Ss   17:54   0:00 sshd: root@pts/0    
root      1569  0.0  0.7   6540  3584 ?        Ss   17:56   0:00 /usr/sbin/sshd -D
root      1701  0.0  0.2   3648  1260 pts/0    S+   18:13   0:00 grep ssh

And then I set the Client account through all the three methods:
Password login:
• ping 10.97.85.71
After I made sure that the server indeed responded, I then stopped it.
• ssh jingjing@10.97.85.71
Password-less login:
• ssh-keygen
I obtained the key's randomart image as:
	+---[RSA 2048]----+
	|     .o..        |
	|       o         |
	|      o          |
	|    .o o         |
	|     *= S.       |
	|  . +.o.. .      |
	|ooo..  o o       |
	|+o.o    =        |
	| .o.   E         |
	+-----------------+
• ssh-copy-id -i jingjing@10.97.85.71
• ssh jingjing@10.97.85.71
Passphrase-less login:
• ssh-add
• ssh -X jingjing@10.97.85.71

Finally, I run programs using GUI, and it worked successfully after I used -Y option.
• xterm
• firefox
